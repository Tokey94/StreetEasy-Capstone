Analyzing the Impact of Covid-19 on NYC Rental Market.

This project explores the data that was provided by StreetEasy to better understand the impact of covid-19 on the NYC rental market. The inventory and median rent prices data was used for this project. I also used Facebook’s Prophet time series model to create a forecast of what 2020 data should have looked like and then I compared it to the actual 2020 data to show the impact of covid-19.   
My data was downloaded directly from StreetEasy’s website. https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/?agg=Total&metric=Inventory&type=Rentals&bedrooms=Any%20Bedrooms&property=Any%20Property%20Type&minDate=2010-01&maxDate=2020-07&area=Flatiron,Brooklyn%20Heights

Many of the visuals were created using Tableau Public. https://public.tableau.com/profile/toliy.anchakov
